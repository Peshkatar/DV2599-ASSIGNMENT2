- Introduction
  o Problem formulation (comparing algorithms)
  o Experimentation (statistics introdcution)
  o Spambase data set

- Method
  o Preprocessing (data cleaning, distribution, discretization [SVM])
  o Computing Friedman & Nemenyi
  o Chosen algorithms
  o Code and algorithm implementation (object oriented)
  o Training and evaluation (cross validation. f-measure, accuracy, computation time)

- Results
  o Data cleaning and transformation results
  o Critical value, Friedman test, critical difference and nemenyi-score
  o Model evaluation results (tables. f-measure, accuracy, computation time)
